# Self-Preference Leaderboard

Open `index.html` directly in a browser or serve this directory with any static
file server. The page has no build step and no JavaScript dependency.

## Result sources

- `docs/experiment.md` supplies the primary position-adjusted self-preference
  results, aggregate generator performance, and experiment counts.
- `data/analysis/self_preference/` contains the generated model-, pairwise-, and
  question-level secondary score artifacts.

Charts are inline SVG and can be edited without adding a JavaScript dependency.
Shared colors, fonts, and dimensions are defined as custom properties at the top
of `styles.css`.

The page separates overall answer quality, blinded single-turn results, blinded
multi-turn results, and the paired model-unblinded comparison into independent
anchor sections.

The Google Fonts import is optional; system font fallbacks are already included.
